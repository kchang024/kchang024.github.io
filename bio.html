            <h2>Short Biography</h2>    
            <p class="bio">I was born in New York, NY. I grew up in Manhattan's Lower East 
               Side near Chinatown. Once I graduated high school, I left the Big
               Apple for Boston. I attended Northeastern University, and
               graduated with a B.S. Psychology. I'm currently in Tuft's 
               Computer Science PostBac program and plan to pursue graduate 
               studies in Computer Science. </p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p class="bio">I love to cook and eat! If I could travel the world, I would. 
               I'm into basketball, photography, video games, technology, 
               and more... </p>
